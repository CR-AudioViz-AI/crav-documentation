Your Knowledge Base is Javari's long-term memory. Upload documents, and Javari will:
- **Extract** all text and data
- **Understand** context and relationships
- **Retrieve** relevant information automatically
- **Cite** sources in responses

### Uploading Documents

**Supported Formats:**

- Save meeting notes

### Using Knowledge Base in Conversations

**Automatic Retrieval:**  
When you ask questions, Javari automatically searches your Knowledge Base for relevant information.

**Example:**
```
You: What are our brand colors?

Javari: According to your style guide (uploaded Oct 15), 
your brand colors are:
- Primary: #0066CC (Brand Blue)
- Secondary: #FF6B35 (Accent Orange)
- Neutral: #333333 (Charcoal)

Source: "Brand-Style-Guide-2025.pdf" page 3
```

**Manual Search:**
```
You: Search my knowledge base for "API authentication"

Javari: I found 3 relevant sections:
1. API-Docs.pdf - "OAuth 2.0 Implementation" (pages 12-15)
2. Security-Guide.md - "Token-Based Auth Best Practices"
3. Project-Notes.txt - "Authentication flowchart notes"

Would you like me to summarize any of these?
```

### Managing Your Knowledge Base

**View All Documents:**
- Click "Knowledge Base" → "All Documents"
- See upload date, file size, page count
- Preview document contents

**Delete Documents:**
- Hover over document
- Click trash icon
- Confirm deletion
- Javari immediately forgets this information

**Update Documents:**
- Upload new version with same filename
- Javari automatically replaces old version
- Maintains version history

---

## CREDENTIAL VAULT

### What is the Credential Vault?

The most secure way to store API keys, passwords, and tokens. Javari uses:
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** (same as banks)
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** (we can't see your credentials)
- **Automatic rotation** (optional, prevents expiration)
- **Complete audit trail** (know exactly when credentials are accessed)

### Adding Credentials

**Quick Add:**
1. **Click** "Credentials" in sidebar
2. **Click** "Add Credential"
3. **Fill in details:**
   - Service name (e.g., "GitHub")
   - Credential name (e.g., "Personal Access Token")
   - Actual credential value
   - Expiration date (optional)
4. **Save** - Encrypted immediately

**Supported Services (with auto-rotation):**
- GitHub personal access tokens
- Vercel API tokens
- Stripe API keys
- OpenAI API keys
- Supabase service keys
- Custom services

### Using Credentials in Conversations

**Automatic Injection:**  
When you work on a project that needs credentials, Javari automatically uses them (after asking permission once).

**Example:**
```
You: Deploy my website to Vercel

Javari: I'll use your Vercel credentials to deploy.
[Deploys using stored Vercel token]
✅ Deployed successfully to https://your-site.vercel.app
```

**Manual Reference:**
```
You: What's my GitHub token?

Javari: For security, I won't display the full token. 
I can tell you:
- Service: GitHub
- Name: Personal Access Token
- Status: Active
- Expires: Never
- Last used: 2 days ago

Would you like me to test if it's still working?
```

### Credential Security

**Automatic Rotation (Optional):**
Enable auto-rotation for supported services:
1. **Edit** credential
2. **Toggle** "Auto-rotate"
3. **Choose** frequency: 30, 60, or 90 days
4. Javari handles rotation automatically
5. **Grace period:** Old credential works for 7 days

**Audit Log:**  
See every time a credential is accessed:
- Date and time
- Which conversation used it
- What action was performed
- Success or failure

**Access from:**  
Credentials → [Credential Name] → "Audit Log"

---

## PROJECTS

Projects organize your work and share credentials across related conversations.

**Project Hierarchy:**
```

## TIPS & BEST PRACTICES

### Getting the Best Results

**1. Be Specific**

❌ Bad:
```
Make me a website
```

✅ Good:
```
Create a landing page for a coffee subscription service.
Include: hero section with image, features list (3 items),
pricing table (3 tiers), email signup form, footer.
Style: Modern, warm colors, mobile-responsive.
```

**2. Provide Context**

❌ Bad:
```
Fix this bug
```

✅ Good:
```
I'm getting "undefined is not an object" error on line 42
of UserProfile.js when the user object doesn't have an email.
How can I add a safety check?
```

**3. Use Projects for Organization**

Instead of scattered conversations, create projects:
- **One project per client/app**
- **Store all credentials in project**
- **Link related conversations**
- **Easier to find information later**

**4. Upload Documentation Early**

Add relevant docs to Knowledge Base at start of project:
- Javari gives better, more specific answers
- No need to repeat requirements
- Consistent with your standards

**5. Take Advantage of Templates**

Don't start from scratch every time:
- Use templates for common tasks
- Customize as needed
- Save your own templates

### Optimizing Credit Usage

**Save credits by:**
1. **Batch requests:** Ask multiple questions at once
2. **Use templates:** Pre-built starting points use fewer credits
3. **Be specific:** Clear requests get right answer first time
4. **Upload docs:** Knowledge Base reduces back-and-forth

**Example - Efficient Request:**
```
I'm building a Node.js API with these requirements:
1. REST endpoints for users (CRUD)
2. PostgreSQL database
3. JWT authentication
4. Rate limiting
5. Input validation

Can you create the complete file structure and 
main server.js file?
```

This uses ~100 credits but gets everything in one shot, versus multiple back-and-forth messages using 200+ credits total.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

#### **"Out of Credits" Error**

**Solution:**
1. Check your current plan and usage
2. Upgrade to higher tier if needed
3. Purchase additional credit packs
4. Wait until next billing cycle (credits refresh)

**Prevent in future:**
- Set up credit alerts (Settings → Notifications)
- Track usage in dashboard
- Use credit-efficient practices above

#### **Javari Doesn't Have Context**

**Problem:** Javari seems to forget previous discussion

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Check if you're in the same conversation
2. ✅ Look for "conversation continued" notice
3. ✅ Upload relevant docs to Knowledge Base
4. ✅ Use project to group related chats

#### **Credential Not Found**

**Problem:** "I don't have access to that credential"

**Solutions:**
1. Add credential to vault
2. Make sure credential is in current project
3. Check credential hasn't expired
4. Verify spelling of credential name

#### **Slow Responses**

**Possible causes:**
- Complex request requiring multiple AI calls
- Large document being processed
- High platform load

**Solutions:**
- Wait patiently (usually resolves in 30-60 seconds)
- Refresh page if longer than 2 minutes
- Check status page: status.javariai.com
- Contact support if persistent

#### **Can't Find Previous Conversation**

**Solutions:**
1. Use search bar with keywords from conversation
2. Check if accidentally deleted
3. Filter by date range
4. Look in specific project
