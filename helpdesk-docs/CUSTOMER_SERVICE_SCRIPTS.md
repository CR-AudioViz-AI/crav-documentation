## Common Scenarios

### Account Issues

**Can't Login:**
"I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me help you get back into your account right away. Can you verify the email address you're using to log in?"

**Password Reset:**
"No problem! I'll send a password reset link to [email] right now. Please check your inbox and spam folder. The link expires in 1 hour."

**Email Not Recognized:**
"I've checked our system and don't see an account with that email. Would you like me to help you create a new account, or did you perhaps use a different email address?"

### Credit Issues

**Credits Not Showing:**
"I can see your purchase was processed successfully. Let me add those [X] credits to your account right now... Done! Your new balance is [X] credits. Please refresh your page."

**Credits Expired:**
"I see those credits were from a one-time purchase on the free plan, which expire after 30 days. On paid plans, credits never expire and roll over each month. Would you like to hear about our paid plans?"

**Want Refund:**
"I understand you'd like a refund. Our policy is 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscriptions. Since [your account is within/outside that window], [I can process that immediately / let me escalate this to my manager for approval]."

### Tool Problems

**Tool Not Working:**
"I'm sorry you're experiencing issues with [tool]. Let me help troubleshoot this. First, can you try refreshing your browser? If that doesn't work, try clearing your cache or using an incognito window."

**Poor Quality Output:**
"I understand the results weren't what you expected. AI can be unpredictable sometimes! I'd be happy to refund those credits and you can try again with a more detailed prompt. I can also share some tips for better results."

**Export Failed:**
"I apologize for the export issue. I've refunded your credits automatically. Let me help you export in a different format - sometimes that resolves the problem. Would you like to try PDF, PNG, or another format?"

### Technical Issues

**Slow Performance:**
"I understand the platform is running slowly for you. Let me check our system status... [Everything looks good on our end / We are experiencing some delays]. Can you tell me what browser you're using and try closing other tabs?"

**Browser Compatibility:**
"For the best experience, we recommend using Google Chrome (latest version). It sounds like you're using [browser]. Would you be able to try Chrome? I can walk you through it."

**Mobile Issues:**
"Our mobile app is launching Q1 2026. For now, I recommend using your mobile web browser. It's fully responsive and should work great. Let me send you the best link to use."

## Upselling Opportunities

### Free Plan User Having Issues
"I notice you're on our free plan. One benefit of our Creator plan ($29/month) is priority support, so issues get resolved faster. Plus, your credits never expire. Would you like to hear more?"

### Running Out of Credits
"I see you're running low on credits. Just so you know, our Creator plan gives you 500 credits per month that never expire - much better value than buying one-time packs. Want to learn more?"

### Using Tools Frequently
"I can see you're really enjoying [tool]! Customers who use it this much usually find our Professional plan ($99/month) gives them much better value with 2,000 monthly credits. Can I share the details?"

**Important:** Only upsell when genuinely helpful, never pushy.
