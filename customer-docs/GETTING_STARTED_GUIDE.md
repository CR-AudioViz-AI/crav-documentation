## Tips for Success

### Getting the Most Value

**1. Start with Templates**
Don't create from scratch! Our templates are professionally designed and save you credits. You only pay for customizations.

**2. Use AI Suggestions**
When AI offers suggestions, try them! It's learned from millions of designs and usually makes things better.

**3. Batch Your Work**
Creating multiple items at once? Use "Duplicate" to copy and modify instead of starting fresh each time.

**4. Save Favorites**
Found a template or color scheme you love? Save it to favorites for instant access later.

**5. Learn Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S`: Save
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z`: Undo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Y`: Redo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + D`: Duplicate
- `Esc`: Cancel/Close

### Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ **Using tools for the wrong purpose**  
✅ Ask Javari which tool is best for your goal

❌ **Not saving work regularly**  
✅ Auto-save is on, but click Save after major changes

❌ **Ignoring error messages**  
✅ Read them! They usually tell you exactly how to fix issues

❌ **Buying too many credits at once**  
✅ Start small. See what you actually use monthly.

❌ **Not exploring templates**  
✅ Templates save time and money. Customize, don't start from scratch.
